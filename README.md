### A Pinterest-inspired app developed in ASP.NET/C#, using MVC architecture and a SQL Server database.
- It lets the authenticated user share photos, videos, GIFs, and comments, as well as like and save posts to personalized collections/boards on their profile. They can also edit or delete their previous posts, comments or collections/boards. 
- A guest user can see posts and comments from authenticated users, but they can't post, comment, like or have their own collections/boards. 
- The admin user can only delete posts or comments from any authenticated user.
